### **Software Engineer** @ [Almundo](https://almundo.com.ar/)  _(Mar 2018 - Present)_ <br>

Design and Development of features under Assisted Sales team, focused on providing efficient and intuitive tools to the sales and post-sale staff members. Some of the projects I worked on  (in no particular order):

1. _Experts Ranking:_
   - Service built from scratch, designed to calculate metrics across several data sources, and rank company's sellers (experts) according to those metrics and several context-bound factors, in order to offer customers the most relevant experience. I participated in the architectural design and development of all of the components of this application, two micro-services written in Java 11 + Spring Boot, interfacing with several SQL and noSQL databases.
2. _Tickets:_
   - Back-end service built from scratch intended to work as an in-house incidents tracker solution, intended to replace a third party CRM post-sales issues register module, used by the post-sale staff. I was in charge of the design and development of this service 
3. _Contacts History:_
   - Service built from scratch, design to interface with legacy and third party CRM services containing customer's incidents and transactions data. This service was built using NodeJS as a back-end technology, I participated from the start of in the design and development.
4. _Trip-Planner:_
   - Maintenance and new features development for the main selling tool used by the company's sell staff and branch offices. I was assigned with the refactoring and corrections of existing code smells, I was also in charge of migrating from Java 8 to 14, and as well in the development of new features. 
5. Opportunities:
   - Back-end service, built from the ground up, in charge of listening and analyzing different kinds of events (sells, web-sites queries, cross-selling events, etc) and translate them to actionable items, such as Notifications, directed to the sells team. I've been involved from the earlier stages in the design and development of this service: Java 12 + Spring Boot micro-service.
6. _Trip-Products:_
   - Back-end service conceived as a facade for other assisted-sales services (*Trip-Planner*, *Opportunities*) to interact in an abstract way with all of the company's existing products (Flights, Hotels, Cars, etc). I was in charge of the decoupling from *Trip-Planner* and of the design and development of the resulting micro-service.
7. Attentions (CVC-Corp):
   - Description TBD
8. Task Broker (CVC-Corp):
   - Description TBD

- **_Technologies highlights:_** Docker, Kubernetes, NGINX, Java(8-16), Spring Boot (1-2), NodeJS + Typescript + Express, MongoDB, MySQL, RabbitMQ, ELK, CI/CD using Gitlab + Jenkins, VCS with git + gitFlow.
